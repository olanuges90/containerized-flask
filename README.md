# Containerizing a Python Flask App With Docker and Deploy On AWS Using Amazon ECS, API Gateway and Elastic load balancer (ELB)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on containerizing a Python Flask Application for Sports API management using Docker and deploying it on AWS with a robust, scalable architecture. The deployment leverages Amazon ECS (Fargate) for container orchestration, an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for distributing traffic across multiple containers, and API Gateway for exposing the applicationâ€™s REST endpoints securely. This setup ensures high availability, scalability, and efficient handling of incoming requests, making the application production-ready.
