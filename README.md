# Containerizing a Python Flask App With Docker and Deploy on AWS Using Amazon ECS, API Gateway and Elastic load balancer (ELB)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on containerizing a Python Flask Application for Sports API management using Docker and deploying it on AWS with a robust, scalable architecture. The deployment leverages Amazon ECS (Fargate) for container orchestration, an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for distributing traffic across multiple containers, and API Gateway for exposing the applicationâ€™s REST endpoints securely. This setup ensures high availability, scalability, and efficient handling of incoming requests, making the application production-ready.

## Features
- Containerized Python Flask application and its dependencies into a lightweight, portable Docker container.
- Deployment on AWS ECS (Fargate).
- Ensures even traffic distribution across multiple container instances using Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
- Exposes RESTful API endpoints of the Flask application securely.
- Amazon ECR for Docker Image Management.
- API management and routing using API Gateway
- Exposes Application's REST API endpoints securely.

## PreRequisites
- SerpAPI: Signup for Free account and subscribe for API key.
- AWS Free account with appropriate roles for user: (i.e AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess).
- AWS CLI Installed and Configured to interact with AWS account.
- SerAPI Library Installed.
- Docker Desktop Installed: To Build Docker file and Push Docker Images.

## Technological Stacks
- AWS Cloud platform
- AWS Core services: Amazon ECS (Fargate), Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Amazon ECR, API Gateway
- Containrization Service: Docker
- Programming Language: Python 3.x
- IAM Security (Principle of Least Priviledge for AWS Core services)

## Set Up Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

       git clone https://github.com/olanuges90/containerized-flask.git
       cd containeirzed-flask/
   
2. Create ECR Repository

   In the CLI, run the following commands:

       aws configure 
       aws ecr create-repository --repository-name sports-api --region us-east-1

3. Authenticate Docker with ECR. Build, Tag and Push Image.

   In the CLI, run the following command:
   Replace <AWS_ACCOUNT> with your AWS ACCOUNT ID
   
       #Authenticate Docker with ECR
       aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

       #Build and tag the Docker image
       docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t sports-api .
       docker tag sports-api:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sports-api:sports-api-latest

       #Push the Docker image
       docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sports-api:sports-api-latest
   
4. Set Up Amazon ECS (Fargate)
   - Create ECS Cluster:
     - In your AWS Management console, search for ECS, click  Clusters and create Cluster.
     - Provide a Cluster name, select AWS Fargate (serverless) for Infrastructure and create Cluster.
   - Define a Task Definition:
     - Navigate to Task Definitions, click Create New Task Definition.
     - Specify a unique task definition family name.
     - Select AWS Fargate as Launch type.
     - Specify a container name and Image URI (<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sports-api:sports-api-latest).
     - Type 8080 as Container port, select TCP as Protocol and HTTP as App Protocol.
     - Click Add Environment variables. Add Key as "SPORTS_API_KEY", Value as <YOUR_SERAPI_KEY>.
     - Then click Create.
       
5. Create an ECS service
     - Create Service:
       - Navigate to Clusters, click on Clusters and select the created Cluster.
       - Select Service and click Create, select the Task Definition Family created.
       - Assign a Service name.
       - Select "Replica" as Service type.
       - Choose "2" as Desired Task (We need 2 containers to handle traffic spike).
     - Network Configuration:
       - Create a New Security Group.
       - Select "All TCP" as Type and Source as "Anywhere".
    - Configure Load Balancing:
       - Load Balancing Type: Select Application Load Balancer.
       - Assign a name for Load balancer.
       - Health Check group: Type "/sports".
       - Then click Create.
         
  6. Verify Application Load Balancer
      - In the EC2 Dashboard, Navigate to Application Load Balance and select.
      - Verify the state of the Load Balancer as "Provisioning". scroll down to service and wait till deployment and Task is completed (2/2).
      - Click the ALB created, Navigate to the DNS Name.
      - Copy and Paste the DNS name in your browser to confirm the API is accessible and click Enter.
 
  7. Set Up API Gateway
    - Create API:
     - In the AWS management console, search for API Gateway and click.
     - Click Create API.
     - Navigate to REST API and click Build.
     - Assign a Name to your API and click Create API.
- Create a Resource:
     - Click Create Resource and Define Resource Path (/sports).
     - Click Create Resource.
- Create a Method:
     - Click Create Method.
     - Method Type: Select GET.
     - Integration Type: Select HTTP.
     - Toggle on "HTTP Proxy integration".
     - HTTP Method: Select GET.
     - Endpoint URL: Copy your ALB DNS Name and Paste. Type your Endpoint "/sports" behind the ALB URL.
     - Then Click Create Method.

  8. API Deployment
  - Click Deploy API.
  - Stage: Select New Stage.
  - Stage Name: Type Dev.
  - Then Deploy.
 
  9. Test the Deployment
  - Access the application via the API Gateway endpoint or ALB public URL.
    - Copy Invoke URL and Paste in your Browser.
    - Add your endpoint "/sports" behind the URL and click Enter.

           https://<api-gateway-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/sports

  ## Future Enhancements
  - Built a frontend responsive design.
  - Add HTTPS support to the ELB using an SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
  - Configure CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.
